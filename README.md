# TheatreCMS Capstone Project

## Overview
TheatreCMS is an ASP.NET MVC web application developed as my capstone project using Microsoft Visual Studio. The application is a content management system (CMS) designed for a theater organization to manage website content, productions, and community-facing information.

This project demonstrates my ability to work within a professional MVC architecture, contribute to a large codebase, and implement responsive front-end features using Razor views.



## Solution Structure
- **TheatreCMS3.sln** – Visual Studio solution file
- **TheatreCMS3** – Main ASP.NET MVC application

Key directories include:
- **Controllers** – Handles application routing and request logic
- **Models** – Represents application data and business logic
- **Views** – Razor (.cshtml) files for UI rendering
- **Content** – CSS, images, and static assets
- **Scripts** – JavaScript files
- **Migrations** – Entity Framework database migrations
- **App_Data** – Database-related files
- **Helpers** – Utility and helper classes



## My Contributions
I contributed primarily to the front-end and UI layer of the application, focusing on clean layout, content organization, and responsive design.

### Views and UI Development
- Developed and modified Razor views in `Views/Home`, including:
  - `Index.cshtml`
  - `About.cshtml`
  - `Contact.cshtml`
  - `Donate.cshtml`
  - `SignIn.cshtml`
- Implemented dynamic asset paths using `@Url.Content`
- Structured responsive layouts using the Bootstrap grid system
- Created and styled sections for:
  - Homepage hero and spotlight content
  - Donations call-to-action
  - Sponsor logo display
  - Land Acknowledgement section with external resource links

### Front-End Best Practices
- Used semantic HTML for maintainability
- Applied accessibility-conscious markup (alt text, clear headings)
- Ensured consistent layout across different screen sizes
- Maintained separation of concerns within the MVC pattern
